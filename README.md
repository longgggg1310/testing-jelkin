# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub, Jenkins, and Ngrok

## Overview
This project implements a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, and Ngrok to automate the process of testing, building, and deploying an application. The pipeline is triggered by GitHub Actions or Jenkins, and Ngrok is used to expose local services for external access.

## Technologies Used
- **GitHub**: Version control and workflow automation with GitHub Actions
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD automation tool for build and deployment
- **Ngrok**: Secure tunnel to expose local services to the internet
- **Python/R**: Application development and testing
- **SQL**: Database management
- **BigQuery & Looker Studio (Optional)**: Data analysis and visualization

## Pipeline Workflow
1. **Code Push to GitHub**: Any push or pull request to the repository triggers the CI/CD workflow.
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Checkout code from the repository.
   - Install dependencies.
   - Run tests.
3. **Jenkins Pipeline (Optional for Advanced CI/CD)**:
   - Pull latest changes from GitHub.
   - Install dependencies and run tests.
   - Deploy the application to a staging or production environment.
4. **Ngrok for Local Testing**:
   - Create a tunnel for external access to a local development server.

## Setup Guide
### Prerequisites
- Install Git and set up a GitHub repository.
- Install Jenkins and configure GitHub Webhook.
- Install Ngrok for port forwarding.
- Ensure you have a good understanding of statistical methods, data visualization, and proficiency in Python or R.
- SQL skills are required, and familiarity with BigQuery and Looker Studio is a plus.
- A strong problem-solving mindset, attention to detail, and the ability to work under pressure are essential.
- Effective communication skills are needed to present complex data analyses clearly.
- Passion for the gaming industry and understanding of player behavior and game scenarios are preferred.
- English proficiency is an advantage for reading, writing, and communication.

## 1. Setting Up GitHub Actions
Create a workflow file `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest
```

## 2. Setting Up Jenkins Pipeline
Create a `Jenkinsfile` in your repository:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 3. Exposing Local Services with Ngrok
Run the following command to expose a local server (e.g., Flask running on port 5000):

```sh
ngrok http 5000
```

Ngrok will provide a public URL that you can use to test webhooks or external integrations.

## Deployment
- The application can be deployed automatically using GitHub Actions and Jenkins.
- Use Ngrok for testing local deployments before pushing to a cloud server.
